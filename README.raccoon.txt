The processing script 'Kquijano_Evaluate_Raccoon_Life.py' (Python 3.6) uses the input file  "2008Male00006.txt" and: 

	- Reads csv file from a Raccoon behavior model. 
	- Creates a dictionary with headers as key terms and columns as values. 
	- Stores data in appropiate data type. 
	- Write functions to compute mean, cumulative sum of lists and distance between two lists.
	- Adds list of distances as a ne item in dictionary. 

Output: "Georges_life.txt"
	- Header includes Raccoon name, and computed Average location (X,Y), Distance traveled, 	  Average energy level, and a note about the Raccoon end state
	- TAB delimited columns for Date, Time, X and Y coordinates, the Asleep flag, the behavior 		  mode, and the distance traveled
